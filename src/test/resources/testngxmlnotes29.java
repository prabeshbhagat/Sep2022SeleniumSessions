	//testng is a runner file 
	// to run multiple test
	//1st 2 lines are schema
	//verbose will give extra logs
	// the maximum value of verbose will be 10 minimum value will be 1
	//range of Verbose
	//verbose will tell how verbose or how detailed your logs are 
	//more the vlaue more logs it will generate
	//value of verbose =3 0r 4 is more than enough
	
	//pacakgename.classname 
	
	//we can pass parameters 
	
	//achive cross browser testing 
	//passing browser type in parameter
	
	//it will run in sequential mode 1st 
	//with parallel
	//parallel=tests tests means test block 
	
	//thread count max can be 10
	// with docker thread count can be 25 30
	
	//in sequential 1 thread will be generated
	//in parallel mode multiple thread will be generated
	
	//Selenium is a automation library
	//parallel execution is not possible with selenium, we need testng
	//testng can be used with appium 
	// selenium needs testng
	//cucumber is bdd based framework , in bdd we have to create faeture files
	//you have write test cases in testng again write in feature file 
	//who is responsible for feature file
	//feature file is big headache if you are using feature file who will take care 
	//of feature files.
	//in bdd framework we collaborate with dev ,BA,PO,engineers
	//all should work together to create the feature file
	//& most of the company will give responsibility to QA only 
	//QA is not responsible for feature file 
	//BA & PO should come & write the feature file along with QA & DEv
	//its a collaborative approach

	
	//how to run single test in multiple browser
	//copy the same test and change the test name and pass different browser
	
	
	//these day test data are mainatined in script in class name 
	//these are static data
	//these are haevy libararie--dataprovider
	//when supplier is supplying data
	//maintaiing data in excel is also difficult
	
	//better to maintain test data in code itself
	//for nonstatic data we can maintain in excel
	
	//external dependecy are not maintained properly
